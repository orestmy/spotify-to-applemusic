# Development Plan for Spotify to Apple Music Playlist Transfer Website

This repository will host a small web service that allows users to move liked/followed artists, songs, playlists from Spotify to Apple Music. Below is a high-level outline of how the project can be structured. Maybe something like github between liked artists between two?

## Backend
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Framework:** Flask for the web server
- Use `spotipy` (or similar) to access the Spotify API.
- Implement logic for connecting to Apple Music's API to create playlists based on Spotify data.
- Expose REST endpoints for authentication and playlist transfer.

## Frontend
- A lightweight single-page application written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You may use a framework like React or keep it simple with plain JS.
- Provide a UI for users to log in to Spotify, pick a playlist, and trigger the transfer.
- Communicate with the Flask backend using fetch/AJAX calls.

## Steps to Build
1. Set up the Flask project structure and install dependencies.
2. Implement OAuth authentication with Spotify (and Apple Music if required).
3. Create backend routes:
   - `/login` for handling Spotify auth flow.
   - `/transfer` to process playlist transfer requests.
4. Build the frontend interface with login buttons, playlist selection, and status messages.
5. Test the complete flow from login to playlist creation on Apple Music.
